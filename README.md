### **[Getting Started ](https://eigr.io/spawn/docs/getting_started.html)** ‚Ä¢ **[Website](https://eigr.io/spawn)** ‚Ä¢ **[Documentation](https://eigr.io/spawn/docs/)** ‚Ä¢ **[Blog](https://eigr.io/blog/)**


## Overview

**Spawn is your actor-native service mesh for durable, stateful computing ‚Äî polyglot by design, protocol-agnostic by nature.**
**Write once, run over all protocols:** Erlang-native, gRPC, or HTTP with automatic transcoding. One implementation, accessible everywhere. No boilerplate, no glue code ‚Äî just clean actor abstractions that speak all your transports fluently.

Spawn simplifies the hardest part of distributed systems ‚Äî **managing state at scale** ‚Äî by wrapping it in an actor model that's native to modern protocols and tooling. Built by contributors to [Cloudstate](https://github.com/cloudstateio/cloudstate), it brings durable computing to your favorite language: Elixir, Java, TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Dart... you name it.

With Spawn, you stop worrying about infrastructure glue and start delivering business value faster.

## Why You'll Love Spawn ‚ù§Ô∏è

* **Durable Computing via Actors:** Your business logic is always-on and stateful, with snapshotting, passivation, and automatic recovery baked in.

* **Write Once, Run With All Protocols:**
Define your service once using Protobuf annotations:

  ‚úÖ Native Erlang invocation.

  ‚úÖ gRPC for high-performance internal APIs.

  ‚úÖ HTTP transcoding for REST endpoints.

* **Polyglot by Design:**
Code in Elixir, Go, Java, TypeScript, Python, Rust, Lua and more. Spawn speaks your language ‚Äî literally. Use the best tool for each job without sacrificing interoperability.

* **Workflows Made Easy:**
Spawn makes orchestrating complex business processes a breeze. Compose actions using **Side-effects**, chain logic with **Pipes**, or forward and routing requests seamlessly with **Forwards** ‚Äî all first-class citizens in the Spawn model.

* **Projection Actors:**
Need materialized views? Spawn supports **Projection Actors** ‚Äî dedicated actors that derive and maintain views of your system state in real-time. Perfect for read optimization, analytics, or integrating with external systems.

* **Seamless Scalability:**
Spawn‚Äôs actor model naturally scales to match your system‚Äôs needs, from on-premises deployments to massive cloud clusters. High availability and fault-tolerance come built-in.

* **Simplified Infrastructure:**
Forget about wiring up complex distributed systems or state management libraries. Spawn abstracts the hard parts, so you can focus on building features that deliver real value.

* **First-Class Observability:**
Out of the box, Spawn provides hooks for **metrics**, **tracing**, and **logging**. Gain full visibility into your actors and workflows to monitor health, diagnose issues, and optimize performance at scale.

Example? Here you go:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

import "google/api/annotations.proto";
import "spawn/actors/extensions.proto";

package example.actors;

service ExampleActor {
  option (spawn.actors.actor) = {
    kind: NAMED
    stateful: true
    state_type: ".example.ExampleState"
    snapshot_interval: 60000 //optional
    deactivate_timeout: 3000 //optional
  };

  rpc Sum(.example.ValuePayload) returns (.example.SumResponse) {
    option (google.api.http) = {
      post: "/v1/example/sum"
      body: "*"
    };
  }
}
```

**Implement once, access everywhere.**

---

Example Implementation (Elixir):

```elixir
defmodule SpawnSdkExample.Actors.ExampleActor do
  use SpawnSdk.Actor, name: "ExampleActor"
  alias Example.ExampleState
  alias Example.ValuePayload
  alias Example.SumResponse

  @doc """
  Invoke with:

  alias Example.Actors.ExampleActor

  ExampleActor.sum(%Example.ValuePayload{value: 10})
  """
  action("Sum", fn %Context{state: state} = ctx, %ValuePayload{value: value} = data ->
    new_value = state.value + value

    Value.of()
    |> Value.state(%ExampleState{value: new_value})
    |> Value.response(%SumResponse{value: new_value})
  end)
end
```

**Now you can call it from multiple ways. Like from Java:**

```java
package io.eigr.spawn.java.demo;

import io.eigr.spawn.api.Spawn;
// other imports ommited

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Spawn spawnSystem = new Spawn.SpawnSystem()
              .create("spawn-system")
              .build();

        spawnSystem.start();

        // Create a reference to the actor "ExampleActor"
        ActorRef exampleActor = spawnSystem.createActorRef(
            ActorIdentity.of("spawn-system", "ExampleActor")
        );

        // Prepare the input message
        ValuePayload payload = ValuePayload.newBuilder()
            .setValue(10)
            .build();

        // Invoke the "Sum" action
        Optional<SumResponse> maybeResponse = exampleActor.invoke(
            "Sum",
            payload,
            SumResponse.class
        );

        // Handle the response
        if (maybeResponse.isPresent()) {
            SumResponse response = maybeResponse.get();
            System.out.println("Sum result: " + response.getValue());
        } else {
            System.out.println("No response received from the actor.");
        }
    }
}
``` 

**Or invoke directly with grpc**
```bash
grpcurl -d '{"value":10}' \
  -plaintext localhost:9000 \
  example.actors.ExampleActor/Sum
```

**Or also via HTTP/JSON transcoding with any client http**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/v1/example/sum \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": 10}'

```

**One contract ‚Üí multiple protocols ‚Üí instant productivity.**

## Built For Polyglot Teams üåç

Spawn lets your team pick the right language for each service ‚Äî Elixir, Java, TypeScript, Rust, Python ‚Äî without reinventing the wheel. Actors are defined once and consumed seamlessly across your stack.

---

## Infrastructure? Boring. Let Spawn Handle That. ü™Ñ

Forget about Kubernetes YAML hell, service meshes, and complex orchestration. Spawn abstracts all of that ‚Äî actors get scheduled, state gets persisted, protocols get exposed ‚Äî automatically with just one manifest.

Focus on what matters: **business logic.**

## How Spawn Empowers Your Team üöÄ

‚úÖ Accelerate development with consistent patterns.

‚úÖ Scale easily across cloud and on-premises.

‚úÖ Run resilient, stateful apps out-of-the-box.

‚úÖ Embrace polyglot architectures without friction.

‚úÖ Deploy with confidence, backed by a robust runtime.

## Meet Sepp: Our Cyberpunk Mascot ü¶å

Say hello to Sepp, our cyberpunk mascot and proud [Ibex](https://alpshiking.swisshikingvacations.com/spotlight-on-the-ibex/). Sepp, hailing from the Swiss Alps, loves wandering through the Eiger mountains. Despite occasional Viking-like bluntness, he's a helpful companion who traces his lineage back to Viking times.

The name "Sepp" is indeed a German diminutive or nickname for the name Joseph. It's similar to how "Joe" is used as a nickname for Joseph in English. In German-speaking regions, it's common for Joseph to be affectionately referred to as "Sepp."

This is our little tribute to one of the creators of the Erlang programming language, [Joe Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Armstrong_(programmer)).
