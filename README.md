## Overview

Spawn is an actor-based service mesh that abstracts away infrastructure complexities while offering a powerful, polyglot API that accelerates business development. Built by contributors to [Cloudstate](https://github.com/cloudstateio/cloudstate), Spawn simplifies stateful application design for cloud or on-premises environments.

With support for multiple programming languages, Spawn empowers teams to work faster and smarter, using the best tools for the job. Whether you're scaling up or refining internal processes, Spawn‚Äôs architecture allows you to focus on what matters: delivering value to your business.

Explore how Spawn can help you meet your business objectives efficiently. Check out our [documentation](docs/index.md) and [installation guide](docs/install.md) to [get started](docs/getting_started.md).

## Why Spawn?

## Meet Sepp: Our Cyberpunk Mascot

Say hello to Sepp, our cyberpunk mascot and proud [Ibex](https://alpshiking.swisshikingvacations.com/spotlight-on-the-ibex/). Sepp, hailing from the Swiss Alps, loves wandering through the Eiger mountains. Despite occasional Viking-like bluntness, he's a helpful companion who traces his lineage back to Viking times.

The name "Sepp" is indeed a German diminutive or nickname for the name Joseph. It's similar to how "Joe" is used as a nickname for Joseph in English. In German-speaking regions, it's common for Joseph to be affectionately referred to as "Sepp."

This is our little tribute to one of the creators of the Erlang programming language, [Joe Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Armstrong_(programmer)).
