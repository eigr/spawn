## Overview

Spawn is an actor-based service mesh that abstracts away infrastructure complexities while offering a powerful, polyglot API that accelerates business development. Built by contributors to [Cloudstate](https://github.com/cloudstateio/cloudstate), Spawn simplifies stateful application design for cloud or on-premises environments.

With support for multiple programming languages, Spawn empowers teams to work faster and smarter, using the best tools for the job. Whether you're scaling up or refining internal processes, Spawn’s architecture allows you to focus on what matters: delivering value to your business.

Explore how Spawn can help you meet your business objectives efficiently. Check out our [documentation](docs/index.md) and [installation guide](docs/install.md) to [get started](docs/getting_started.md).

## Why Spawn?

- **Simplified Infrastructure:** Spawn abstracts the complex backend architecture so developers can focus on writing business logic, not managing infrastructure.
- **Stateful Computing Made Easy:** Spawn handles state management natively, allowing your applications to be both scalable and resilient across distributed systems.
- **Polyglot Flexibility:** Build in the language of your choice, from Elixir to Java to TypeScript and others, all within the same ecosystem.
- **Seamless Scalability:** Whether you’re deploying in the cloud or on-premises, Spawn grows with your business, ensuring high availability and performance.
- **Designed for Business Needs:** Optimize productivity by streamlining your development process with a runtime that enables rapid time-to-market for critical features.

## How Spawn Empowers Your Business

By abstracting infrastructure, Spawn lets engineers focus on what truly drives growth—building features that matter. With automated state management and simplified configuration, Spawn accelerates development cycles and enhances team efficiency.

For technical leaders, Spawn provides the confidence to meet business goals more efficiently, enhancing competitiveness without compromising on scalability or technical robustness.

## Meet Sepp: Our Cyberpunk Mascot

Say hello to Sepp, our cyberpunk mascot and proud [Ibex](https://alpshiking.swisshikingvacations.com/spotlight-on-the-ibex/). Sepp, hailing from the Swiss Alps, loves wandering through the Eiger mountains. Despite occasional Viking-like bluntness, he's a helpful companion who traces his lineage back to Viking times.

The name "Sepp" is indeed a German diminutive or nickname for the name Joseph. It's similar to how "Joe" is used as a nickname for Joseph in English. In German-speaking regions, it's common for Joseph to be affectionately referred to as "Sepp."

This is our little tribute to one of the creators of the Erlang programming language, [Joe Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Armstrong_(programmer)).
